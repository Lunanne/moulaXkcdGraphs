This is a hobby project to visualize the stats Chogon publishes [here](http://account.mystonline.com/stats/vstats.json) in XKCD style graphs. Because why not.

Credits:  
[XKCD graph JS library](http://dan.iel.fm/xkcd/) by Dan Foreman-Mackey. I customized it for this particularly purpose, but these changes were small.

Anyone who wants can host this, I don't have a personal webserver and can't be buggered to set one up. You'll need to run

    npm install
    bower install

After which you should have all required files. Feel free to poke this code yourself or bother me for changes. I might even make them.
